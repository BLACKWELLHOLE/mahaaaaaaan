<li><strong>1944</strong>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leave behind his pregnant wife, and flies to mexico to head a new Plant Pathology program.Over the next 16 years, his team breed 6000 different strains of disease resistent wheat- including different varieties for each major climate on earth. </li>

Says GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
<li><strong>2009</strong>- dies at the age of 95. </li>
